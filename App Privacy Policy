3. Permitted Use
You agree to use Mentilo only for lawful purposes and in accordance with game rules. Automated interactions, exploits, or manipulation of leaderboards and matchmaking are prohibited. We reserve the right to remove suspicious scores, anonymize or block offensive usernames, and suspend access in case of misuse.

7. Warranties & Liability
Mentilo is provided "as is" without warranties of uninterrupted availability or error-free operation. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the app. Mandatory statutory rights remain unaffected.
